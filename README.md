DIGSI Protection Relay Guide
Interactive artifact 
I've created a comprehensive mobile HTML app for DIGSI 4.87 / DIGSI 5 protection relay software. Here's what's included:
Key Features:
6 Main Sections: Overview, DIGSI 4.87, DIGSI 5, Configuration, Testing, and Troubleshooting
1% margins throughout for maximum content display
Small font titles (18px for main heading, progressively smaller for subsections)
Mobile-optimized with responsive design and touch-friendly tabs
No 3D effects - clean, flat design with subtle gradients
No search bar - simple tab navigation
Content Coverage:
Software comparison and system requirements
Step-by-step installation and configuration guides
Protection function settings (overcurrent, distance, differential)
CFC programming basics for DIGSI 5
Testing procedures (primary and secondary injection)
Troubleshooting common issues
Best practices and safety warnings
The app uses a modern dark blue gradient theme with good contrast for readability on mobile devices. All information is organized in collapsible sections with color-coded info boxes, warnings, and code blocks for easy reference in the field.
